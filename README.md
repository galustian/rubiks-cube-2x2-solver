# 2x2 Rubik's Cube solver
Using Breadth-First search to find the optimal solution for a scramble. The only problem is javascript; it stops execution if the scramble takes too long to solve... There are still some optimizations to make... To try, run

`python -m http.server`

or some other server in the main directory.
